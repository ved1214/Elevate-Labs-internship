Indicator,Observation,Evidence,RiskLevel,Recommendation
"Spoofed Sender Domain","Sender domain visually mimics vendor (e.g., secure-paypall.example.com vs paypal.com)","From header in spoofing mail.pdf","High","Block domain at gateway; quarantine matching messages; report to vendor"
"SPF Authentication Failed","Received-SPF: fail for origin IP (example)","Header analysis screenshot","High","Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC; quarantine failures; notify SOC"

"Attachment Present","Invoice attachment referenced (invoice_*.pdf)","Email body; attachment metadata","High","Analyze only in isolated sandbox; do not open on primary host"
"Generic Greeting","Uses 'Dear Customer' instead of personalized name","Email body","Medium","Use in user training material as an indicator"
"External Image Host","Images hosted on third-party hosts (images.example.com)","HTML part img src","Medium","Block external resource loading via mail gateway or rewrite URLs"
