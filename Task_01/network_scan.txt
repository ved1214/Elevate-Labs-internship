# Summary and Triage
Scan range: 192.168.1.0/24
Scan type: TCP SYN (-sS), Service/version detection (-sV), OS detection (-O)
Hosts scanned: 256
Hosts up: 5
Scan duration: 00:00:21

# Key findings:
- 192.168.1.1: SSH (OpenSSH 8.2), HTTP (Apache 2.4.41), HTTPS (nginx 1.18.0). Action: Verify web server patch level, enforce TLS, review SSH auth methods.
- 192.168.1.10: DNS (BIND 9.11.3), SMB (445), NetBIOS (139). Action: Ensure SMB shares require authentication; restrict DNS recursion if not needed.
- 192.168.1.25: UPnP services exposed (1900, 5000, 8000). Action: Disable UPnP on devices if not required; close ports or isolate device.
- 192.168.1.75: RDP (3389) open. Action: Confirm RDP access controls, consider VPN access only and enforce Network Level Authentication (NLA).

# Immediate remediation recommendations:
1. Close or restrict unused services and ports via host firewall or network ACLs.
2. Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (disable password-based SSH where possible; use keys).
3. Patch vulnerable/old service versions (e.g., Apache, BIND) to latest stable releases.
4. Segment sensitive devices and limit management interfaces to admin VLANs or VPNs.
5. Document and retain scan output for audit and follow-up.
