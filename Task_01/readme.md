**🛡️ Network Scanning using Nmap**

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of performing a network scan using Nmap to identify active hosts and open ports within a given subnet. The task was conducted as part of a cybersecurity lab exercise to enhance understanding of reconnaissance techniques and network mapping.

🧩 Command Used
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oN network_scan.txt


Explanation of Command:
Flag	Description
1) -sS Performs a TCP SYN (Stealth) Scan, which is faster and less likely to be logged.
2) 192.168.1.0/24	Specifies the target subnet for scanning (scans all hosts from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254).
3) -oN network_scan.txt	Saves the output in a normal text format to a file named network_scan.txt.

📄 Output Description
• The output file (network_scan.txt) contains:
• A list of active hosts discovered in the subnet.
• Information about open ports and running services for each host.
• Scan summary including total hosts scanned and time taken.
